See `CONTROLS <https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/blob/master/CONTROLS.rst>`_ for the full list of commands

========
Settings
========

------------------
Configuration File
------------------

Configuration files are stored in the ``{HOME}/.config/rtv/`` directory

See `rtv.cfg <https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/blob/master/rtv/templates/rtv.cfg>`_ for the full list of configurable options. You can clone this file into your home directory by running

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rtv --copy-config
    
-------------------
Viewing Media Links
-------------------

You can use `mailcap <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type#Mailcap>`_ to configure
how RTV will open different types of links

.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/ueQ3w0P.gif

|
| A mailcap file allows you to associate different MIME media types, like ``image/jpeg`` or ``video/mp4``, with shell commands.

This feature is disabled by default because it takes a a few extra steps to configure. To get started, copy the default mailcap template to your home directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ rtv --copy-mailcap

This template contains examples for common MIME types that work with popular reddit websites like *imgur*, *youtube*, and *gfycat*. Open the mailcap template and follow the `instructions <https://github.com/michael-lazar/rtv/blob/master/rtv/templates/mailcap>`_ listed inside. 

Once you've setup your mailcap file, enable it by launching rtv with the ``rtv --enable-media`` flag (or set it in your **rtv.cfg**)

---------------------
Environment Variables
---------------------

The default programs that RTV interacts with can be configured through environment variables

``$RTV_EDITOR``
  | A program used to compose text submissions and comments, e.g. **vim**, **emacs**, **gedit**
  | *If not specified, will fallback to* ``$VISUAL`` *and* ``$EDITOR`` *in that order.*

``$RTV_BROWSER``
  | A program used to open links to external websites, e.g. **firefox**, **google-chrome**, **w3m**, **lynx**, **elinks**
  | *If not specified, will fallback to* ``$BROWSER`` *, or try to intelligently choose a browser supported by your system.*

``$RTV_URLVIEWER``
  | A tool used to extract hyperlinks from blocks of text, e.g.  `urlview <https://github.com/sigpipe/urlview>`_, `urlscan <https://github.com/firecat53/urlscan>`_
  | *If not specified, will fallback to urlview if it is installed.*

------------------------
Copying to the Clipboard
------------------------
RTV supports copying submission links to the OS clipboard.
On macOS this is supported out of the box.
On Linux systems you will need to install either `xsel <http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/>`_ or `xclip <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/>`_.

FAQ
===

Why am I getting an error during installation/when launching rtv?
  If your distro ships with an older version of python 2.7 or python-requests,
  you may experience SSL errors or other package incompatibilities. The
  easiest way to fix this is to install rtv using python 3. If you
  don't already have pip3, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/6587528 for setup
  instructions. Then do

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip uninstall rtv
    $ sudo pip3 install -U rtv

Why do I see garbled text like ``M-b~@M-"`` or ``^@``?
  Quick fix
    Try starting RTV in ascii-only mode with ``rtv --ascii``
  
  Explanation
    This type of text usually shows up when python is unable to render
    unicode properly.
    
    1. Make sure that the terminal/font that you're using supports unicode
    2. Try `setting the LOCALE to utf-8 <https://perlgeek.de/en/article/set-up-a-clean-utf8-environment>`_
    3. Your python may have been built against the wrong curses library,
       see `here <stackoverflow.com/questions/19373027>`_ and
       `here <https://bugs.python.org/issue4787>`_ for more information
  
How do I run the code directly from the repository?
  This project is structured to be run as a python *module*. This means that
  you need to launch it using python's ``-m`` flag. See the example below, which
  assumes that you have cloned the repository into the directory **~/rtv_project**.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ~/rtv_project
    $ python3 -m rtv
